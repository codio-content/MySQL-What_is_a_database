We've created a DATABASE called: `people`

List the existing databases in your current `MariaDB [(none)]>` prompt by executing `SHOW DATABASES;` to then see:

```
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| directory          |
| mysql              |
| people             |
| performance_schema |
+--------------------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

### SQL commands capitalization is not mandatory
However, it is a good practice and a convention to use capitalized SQL commands.
__Please note__ that we are going to __use capitalized SQL commands__ for our examples as well as __for the challenges.__

### Semicolons are part of the SQL syntax
Whenever you complete a SQL statement, be sure to append a semicolon `;`. If you forget to type an ending semicolon, a new prompt inside the `MariaDB [(none)]> ` interactive screen will be created: `->`.

There are different types of prompts in the MySQL command line client, here are two of them:

```
-- Prompt  Meaning
MariaDB [(none)]>  Ready for new command. Finish it with the exit command or ctrl+c

->      Waiting for next line of multiple-line command. Finish it with \c or ; and hit enter.
```

In the next section we will `USE` the `people` database and display some data.
