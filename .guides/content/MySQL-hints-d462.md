### Remember to `USE` databases
Whenever you leave the unit and come back again later, the terminal is going to open a new `MariaDB [(none)]>` prompt in some sections automatically for you to keep writing the requested inputs.

Just in case you get an `ERROR 1046 (3D000): No database selected;` error prompt, make sure you switch to the right database using the `USE db_name;` command in order for the commands we present in this unit to work properly.

### The terminal content has reached the bottom?
Whenever you need to clear your terminal inside a `MariaDB [(none)]>` interactive screen or a default terminal prompt `codio ~/workspace $`, __execute the `ctrl + l` keys combination__ to get the prompt to the top most part of the screen.
