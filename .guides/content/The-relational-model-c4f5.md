Think about your favourite app.

Whenever you navigate into it, regardless of the device or browser, some kind of database must be running on the server in order for the data to be present.

A _relational database_ is a tool that stores data and lets you _create_, _select_, _update_ and _delete_ that data:

- __Tables__ are _spreadsheet like_ structures with columns and rows.
- Each database table has a name and there are different naming conventions (singular or plural form, *t_name*, *name_table*).
- A __column__ contains a collection of data related to the name of the column.
- A __row__ contains a collection of data related to that tableâ€™s single item.
