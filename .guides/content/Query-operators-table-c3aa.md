By using the `SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name OPERATOR matching_data;` SQL statement we can expect precise results for our queries.

Here's a detailed table of the available operators and their descriptions:

| OPERATOR | DESCRIPTION                                                                 |
|:--------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =        | Equal                                                                       |
| <>       | Not equal. Note: In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as != |
| >        | Greater than                                                                |
| <        | Less than                                                                   |
| >=       | Greater than or equal                                                       |
| <=       | Less than or equal                                                          |
| BETWEEN  | Between an inclusive range                                                  |
| LIKE     | Search for a pattern                                                        |
| AND      | Displays a record if both the first condition AND the second condition are true |
| OR       | Displays a record if either the first condition OR the second condition is true |


How about getting some _DATE_ datatype from the `basic_info` table of the `people` database by using the _greater than_ query operator?
