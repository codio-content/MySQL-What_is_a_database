A `birthdays.sql` file has been created and opened for you.
Click on it and type a _SELECT * FROM_ statement that gets only the rows that contain birthdays for 2016 plus sorting them by date order:

```
--- In your birthdays.sql file:

USE people;

SELECT * FROM basic_info 
WHERE birthday > '2016' 
ORDER BY birthday;
```

Source it: 

```
MariaDB [(none)]> source birthdays.sql
```
And you should see this:
```
